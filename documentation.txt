# Running fmriprep on the cluster
The goal of this document is to help you understand how to run fmriprep on the IKIM cluster

- Slurm will automatically assign nodes to the jobs you submit
- it is important to limit the communication of the nodes to the NFS file storage
- the preprocessing of all participants is parallelized only across participants
- therefore 1 job = 1 participant
- to minimize IO traffic, everything is handled locally

Here is the basic outline of the "for loop" to submit the jobs
Iterate over the participants in the NFS folder:
- copy the container to the node
- copy the target participant into a BIDS compatible format (incl. dummy description.json)
- write the temp files locally
- output the derivatives locally
- when the preprocessing is complete, copy the derivatives back to the NFS
- delete everything else (temp files, docker container, single-sub BIDS folder)

To handle an upper limit of jobs, so i.e. only 8 simultaneously, we can submit the jobs with a while loop in the
participant level for loop. For this we just check the amount of jobs our USER has currently running, compare that
to the MAX JOBS and either submit a new job (=participant), or we just wait a specific amount and check again, until
all participants are done.
